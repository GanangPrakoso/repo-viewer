# Repo Viewer

## How to run

### `yarn start`

or

### `npm start`

## Dependencies that I used

- axios
- react-router-dom
- sweetalert2
- redux
- redux-thunk

**Note:** For this simple web-application actually redux is not required but I use it because I want to show my knowledge of redux because it is a requirement for this job vacancy.
